# canvas
Create a drawing application that allows the user to draw rectangles, circles, and lines on a canvas. The user should be able to perform free drawing by selecting the desired shape and placing it on the canvas.

Each drawing element should be selectable with a click. Once selected, the user can modify its appearance, including changing the background color (for shapes), line color, line style (solid, dashed, etc.), and line width.

Additionally, make all drawing elements draggable so that users can reposition them on the canvas. The application should also provide functionality to save the entire drawing, preserving the state and appearance of all elements.
